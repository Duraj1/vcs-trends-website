        <p>Version Control Systems, like everything else is constantly evolving and changing. It is <b>vastly</b> different from what it was like several years ago. </p>
        <br>
        <p>However, like in all scientific advances, there were certain milestones that one should be aware of, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1972:Source Code Control System(SCCS)</b> - Developed by Bell Labs, one of the first version control systems.</li><br>
            <li><b>1982:Revision Control System (RCS)</b> - Made by Walter Tichy, it automated tracking changes for individual files using a technology called <i>delta storage</i>, which worked by storing the differences between the file versions</li><br>
            <li><b>1986:Concurrent Version System(CVS)</b> - Created by Dick Grune, it's a front-end to RCS, allowing collaboration on whole projects. It was commonly used in the 1990s owing to its open-soruce and commercial projects</li><br>
            <li><b>2005:Git and Mercurial</b> - 2005 was a breakthrough yeaar for version control, when Linus Torvalds created Git, and Matt Mackall released Mercurial. They were both <b>distributed version control systems(DVCS)</b>, which was revolutionary back then.</li><br>
            <li><b>2008:GitHub launched</b> - In 2008, GitHub - probably the most wide-spread VCS to this day made its debut. With features such as pll requests, issue tracking and networking, it greatly accelerated Git's adoption to the market and in 2010 many teams migrated from CVS, SVN or other tools to Git. </li><br>
            <li><b>2020s:AI and large-scale collaboration</b> - Nowadays, large-scale projects are increasingly more common. Artificial Intelligence has started to assist in code management and review via tools like GitHub Copilot or other AI-driven assistants.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>One of the largest changes probably happened in 2005, when Git and Mercurial introduced Distributed Version Control. Centralized Version Control used so far had many limitations, for example, if the central repo was lost or offline, all the work had to halt and no commits could be made. Distributed systems, like Git or Mercurial didn't use a single, inherent master server, every developer had a perfect copy of the main repository that they could update locally. This solution introduced more flexibility and redundancy.</p>
