        <p>Version control is still being updated, new practices and integrations are emerging with each year, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>GitOps Meets DevOps</b> - GitOps is a relatively new approach, the whole idea is to treat infrastructure configuration and deployment scripts as code in a Git repository, and to use commits, pull requests etc. to manage changes to those configurations. GitOps is essentially an extension of DevOps practices.</li><br>
            <li><b>CI/CD Pipleines Integration</b> - Emphasis on Continuous Integration(CI) and Continous Delivery/Deployment(CD). Integrating VCS with CI/CD leads to faster, more reliable releases. Since all changes are tracked in Git, they are easy to trace back in case of a bug. Pull requests also work as gates in the pipeline, automatically testing the code and merging only the code that passes all the tests and review, which in turn increases the code quality.</li><br>
            <li><b>Cloud-Based VCS(GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)</b> - Cloud-based plaforms have emerged as another major trend for hosting repositories. Services such as GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket have become incredibly common, both for open-source and private code hosting. They offer easy collaboration, issue tracking, project management and Access Control, among many other.</li><br>
            <li><b>AI in Code Management and Review</b> - Artificial Intelligence has started to be used as a tool in the form of AI-driven code assistants and AI-assisted Code Reviewers. AI can easily spot mistakes a human would miss, while also allowing the humans reviewers to focus on more complex tasks at hand.</li>
